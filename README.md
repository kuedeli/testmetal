# 🚀 Antigravity Agent Starter Kit

> A production-ready template for building reliable, self-improving AI agents using a proven 3-layer architecture

## 📹 Overview

The Antigravity Agent Starter Kit is a battle-tested framework for building AI agents that actually work in production. Instead of letting LLMs handle everything (which compounds errors), this architecture separates concerns into three layers: directives (what to do), orchestration (decision making), and execution (deterministic code). The result? Agents that self-improve, handle errors gracefully, and maintain 90%+ reliability even across complex multi-step workflows.

This template includes:
- ✅ Pre-configured 3-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Self-annealing error recovery system that learns from failures
- ✅ Modular skills system for extending agent capabilities
- ✅ Production-ready file organization and best practices
- ✅ Example skills to get you started immediately

It's designed for developers, automation engineers, and AI builders who want to create agents that are reliable, maintainable, and continuously improving.

## 🎨 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🏗️ **3-Layer Architecture** | Separates probabilistic AI decisions from deterministic execution, preventing error compounding and ensuring reliability |
| 🔄 **Self-Annealing System** | Automatically learns from failures, updates directives, and improves over time without manual intervention |
| 🧩 **Modular Skills** | Plug-and-play skill system with progressive disclosure - only loads what's needed when it's needed |
| 📦 **Bundled Resources** | Scripts, references, and assets organized for maximum reusability and minimal context pollution |
| 🎯 **Production-Ready** | Clear file organization, environment management, and cloud-first deliverables built in from day one |

## 🏛️ Architecture

The system follows a clear data flow:

**User Request → Directive (SOP) → Agent Orchestration → Execution Scripts → Cloud Deliverables**

### The 3 Layers Explained

**Layer 1: Directives** (`directives/` folder)
- Standard Operating Procedures written in Markdown
- Define goals, inputs, tools to use, outputs, and edge cases
- Natural language instructions, like you'd give a mid-level employee
- Living documents that improve over time

**Layer 2: Orchestration** (The AI Agent)
- Intelligent routing and decision-making
- Reads directives, calls execution tools in the right order
- Handles errors, asks for clarification, updates directives with learnings
- The glue between intent and execution

**Layer 3: Execution** (`execution/` folder)
- Deterministic Python scripts
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions
- Reliable, testable, fast - no probabilistic behavior
- Well-commented and production-ready

### Why This Works

If the agent does everything itself, errors compound. 90% accuracy per step = 59% success over 5 steps. The solution? Push complexity into deterministic code. The agent focuses on decision-making, not implementation details.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Requirements

You'll need:
- Python 3.8+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- API keys for any services your directives/skills require

### 2️⃣ Download the Template

1. Download or clone this template folder
2. Navigate to the folder in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/Antigravity\ Template\ copy
   ```

### 3️⃣ Set Up Your Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your API keys and environment variables:
   ```
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # Add other API keys as needed
   ```

3. Install any required Python dependencies for your execution scripts:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you create one
   ```

### 4️⃣ Configure Your Agent

1. Review `AGENTS.md` to understand the architecture
2. Create your first directive in `directives/` (or use existing ones)
3. Add execution scripts to `execution/` as needed
4. Point your AI agent (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to read `AGENTS.md` as its system instructions

### 5️⃣ Start Building

Your agent is now ready to:
- Read directives from `directives/`
- Execute scripts from `execution/`
- Use skills from `SKILLS/`
- Self-improve through the annealing loop

## 🧪 What's Included

### Core Files

- **`AGENTS.md`** - The agent's operating manual and architecture guide
- **`SKILLS/`** - Pre-built skills for common tasks:
  - `brand-extractor/` - Extract brand identity from any website
  - `brand-guidelines/` - Enforce consistent brand styling
  - `frontend-design/` - Build beautiful web applications
  - `skill-creator/` - Create new skills following best practices

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Automation Engineers**: Build reliable automation workflows that handle errors gracefully and improve over time
- **AI Developers**: Create specialized agents with domain expertise without retraining models
- **Product Teams**: Deploy AI agents that maintain consistency across complex multi-step processes
- **Consultants**: Package your expertise into reusable skills that agents can execute reliably
- **Startups**: Rapidly prototype AI-powered features with production-ready architecture from day one

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one directive and one execution script. Test the self-annealing loop before scaling up.

2. **Use Skills Wisely**: The included skills demonstrate best practices. Study `skill-creator/SKILL_SkillCreator.md` before creating your own.

3. **Embrace the Annealing Loop**: When things break, let the agent fix the script, test it, and update the directive. The system gets stronger with each failure.

4. **Keep Directives Lean**: Only include what the agent can't figure out on its own. Assume intelligence, provide context.

5. **Cloud-First Deliverables**: Store outputs in Google Sheets, Slides, or other cloud services. Local files are for processing only.

6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Skills use a 3-level loading system (metadata → SKILL.md → bundled resources). Keep context usage minimal.
